/*! \sa  Class Animatable.\n\n
\par Description:
This class is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This is the callback object used to perform the (de)selection via
<b>Animatable:: SvGetMultiSelectCallback()</b>.\n\n
Schematic view supports multiple selection. When the user selects a set of
objects in the schematic view and then "transfers" that selection set to the
rest of max (either by having "synchronize selection" on or by manually moving
the selection out), there are a number of ambiguities that can arise. For
example, some of the objects in the schematic view cannot be selected in the
viewports, material editor, or modifier stack. Another example: the material
editor only supports one active material/map but many materials and maps can be
selected simultaneously in the schematic view. The "MultiSelectCallback" system
exists order to handle these cases and to handle selection synchronization
between SV and future editors in 3ds Max. When the schematic view attempts to
synchronize selection by moving the SV selection set to the "outside" world, it
follows this procedure:\n\n
1. First SV calls SvGetMultiSelectCallback(...) on all the visible SV nodes to
"collect" MultiSelectCallback objects. Objects that want to synchronize their
selection state with the schematic view (not a common or trivial operation --
this is really more associated with adding a new editor in 3ds Max rather than
adding new plugin) return a pointer to a static instance of a
MultiSelectCallback derived object. There is only one instance of a
MultiSelectCallback per editor. Furthermore, if an editor displays objects of
many classes, all the classes should override SvGetMultiSelectCallback(...) to
return the same MultiSelectCallback instance. This implies that, as far as the
schematic view is concerned, there is never more than one primary editor class
associated with any particular object class (currently, viewports for nodes,
material editor for materials and maps and the modifier panel for
modifiers).\n\n
For example, here is the code in BaseNode that returns the MultiSelectCallback
instance for nodes (this is the MultiSelectCallback used for viewports):
\code
class BaseNodeMSelCB : public MultiSelectCallback
{
	private:
		bool clear;
		BaseNodeTab selNodeTab;
		BaseNodeTab deselNodeTab;

		int Priority() { return 1000; }
		void Begin(IGraphObjectManager *gom, bool clear);
		void Select(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode, bool isSelected);
		void End(IGraphObjectManager *gom);
};
static BaseNodeMSelCB baseNodeMSelCB;
MultiSelectCallback* BaseNode::SvGetMultiSelectCallback(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode)
{
	return &baseNodeMSelCB;
}
\endcode 
2. For each selection class (unique MultiSelectCallback instance), the
schematic views calls "Begin(...)". This is the spot where any "pre-selection"
preparation takes place. The order that the MultiSelectCallback instances are
called in is determined by their priority. The priority is returned by the
"Priority()" method. MultiSelectCallback's with a higher priority (lower value)
are called before those with a lower priority (higher value). For example, here
is the Begin associated with the viewports:
\code
void BaseNodeMSelCB::Begin(IGraphObjectManager *gom, bool clear)
{
	this->clear = clear;
//
// If the "clear" bool is true, the current viewport selection set is cleared...
//
		if (clear)
		GetActiveSelSet()->Clear(FALSE);
//
// Some housekeeping in preparation for the select...
//
	selNodeTab.Resize(0);
	deselNodeTab.Resize(0);
}
\endcode 
3. For each of objects in the schematic view whose selection state is changing,
the object's MultiSelectCallback instance is retrieved (again) and the "Select"
method is called. Here is where the actual selection/deselection work can take
place. I say "can" because, in practice, the select method usually just
collects all the objects to be selected and all the objects to be deselected
into lists which are then processed in the "End(...)" method. This is simply
for performance -- it is often more efficient to set the selection state of a
group of objects all at once. Here's the "Select(...)" method from
BaseNode:
\code
void Select(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode, bool isSelected)
{
	BaseNode *baseNode = (BaseNode *) gNode->GetAnim();

	if (isSelected) {
		if (!baseNode->IsRootNode() && !baseNode->IsFrozen()
			&& !baseNode->IsHidden())
			selNodeTab.AppendNode(baseNode, FALSE);
	}
	else {
		if (baseNode->Selected())
			deselNodeTab.AppendNode(baseNode, FALSE);
	}
}
\endcode 
4. Finally, for each selection class (unique MultiSelectCallback instance), the
schematic views calls "End(...)". This is the spot where any "post-selection"
operations take place. For example, here is the "End(...)" for the BaseNode
(viewports):\n\n
\code
void End(IGraphObjectManager *gom)
{
	if (selNodeTab.Count() > 0 || deselNodeTab.Count() > 0) {
		theHold.Begin();
		if (selNodeTab.Count() > 0)
			GetActiveSelSet()->SelectMultiple(selNodeTab, FALSE);

		if (deselNodeTab.Count() > 0)
			GetActiveSelSet()->DeselectMultiple(deselNodeTab, FALSE);

		theHold.Accept(getResMgr().getString(IDS_SV_SELECT, appInst));
		RedrawViewports(GetCOREInterface()->GetTime(), VP_DONT_SIMPLIFY);
	}
	else {
		if (clear)
			RedrawViewports(GetCOREInterface()->GetTime(), VP_DONT_SIMPLIFY);
	}
}
\endcode  */
