 * but it saves client code from the bother of dealing with its HINSTANCE, 
 * of maintaining a buffer, and reduces duplicated code. 
 *
 * Note that this uses a static buffer internally, and is therefore not thread-
 * safe.  Furthermore, if a client needs multiple resource strings 
 * simultaneously, it must copy GetResourceString's result locally before
 * making a subsequent call.
 *
 * \param resourceId Identifier for the desired string resource within the
 * calling module's string table.
 * \return Pointer to a null-terminated character string, or null if the 
 * requested resource is not found.
